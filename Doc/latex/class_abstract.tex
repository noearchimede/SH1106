\subsection{Detailed Description}
any interface to communicate with S\+H1106

The S\+H1106 O\+L\+ED Controller features many different communication interfaces\+:

8-\/bit 6800-\/series parallel 8-\/bit 8080-\/series parallel 3-\/wire S\+PI 4-\/wire S\+PI I2C

\doxyref{This}{p.}{class_this} library was originally intended designed to use i2c, but this interface should not be hardcoded in the higher level functions. Hence this abstract class will be used in all higher level classes and methods declaration instead of an interface-\/specific \char`\"{}concrete\char`\"{} class. \doxyref{This}{p.}{class_this} way changing the communication interface will only require a single change in the constructor of the \char`\"{}next level\char`\"{} class, i.\+e. S\+H1106 (by passing e.\+g. an S\+H1106\+\_\+3\+S\+PI object instead of an \doxyref{S\+H1106\+\_\+\+I2C}{p.}{class_s_h1106___i2_c} one). If there is not any class for the desider interface yet, the user will need to write a class derived from this one. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
