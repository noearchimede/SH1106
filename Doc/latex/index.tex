The S\+H1106 library provides useful functions to write text and images to a display controlled by an S\+H1106 O\+L\+ED driver storing as little data as possible on the microcontroller (no buffer is required).

Currently this library only supports I2C interface, but other interfaces can be easily added (only a little derived class needs to be implemented for every new interface). Other display controllers may be made compatible as well.

The library is structured as follows\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item User classes\+: {\itshape \doxyref{Label}{p.}{class_label}} and {\itshape \doxyref{Image}{p.}{class_image}}
\item S\+H1106 driver class\+: {\itshape \doxyref{S\+H1106\+\_\+driver}{p.}{class_s_h1106__driver}}
\item S\+H1106 interface classes\+: {\itshape S\+H1106\+\_\+interfaces} -\/$>$ {\itshape \doxyref{S\+H1106\+\_\+\+I2C}{p.}{class_s_h1106___i2_c}}, ...
\end{DoxyEnumerate}





The {\itshape \doxyref{Label}{p.}{class_label}} class provides the ability to write any A\+S\+C\+II character and some other symbols in a proportional width font (as opposed to monospaced font), quite small but well readable. The class automatically adds newlines to the printed text taking care not to break words. Calling

{\ttfamily [\doxyref{Label}{p.}{class_label}\+:\+:]print(\char`\"{}\+Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aenean commodo ligula eget dolor. Aenean massa. Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus. Donec quam felis,\char`\"{});}

produces the following printed result\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetuer adipiscing elit
Aenean commodo ligula eget
dolor. Aenean massa. Cum
sociis natoque penatibus et
magnis dis parturient
montes, nascetur ridiculus
mus. Donec quam felis,
\end{DoxyCode}
 It is possible to print text strings and literals stored either in R\+AM or in Flash memory, integer and floating point numbers (optionally aligning numbers on different lines), tabs, some control and other special characters, and any custom symbol saved as plain arrays of bytes. 



The {\itshape \doxyref{Image}{p.}{class_image}} class provides a simple interface to print bitmaps stored in byte arrays. The arrays are print in the order showed in this example, were an image of 5 pixels width and 4 pages height (5 x 32 pixels) is printed. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
03-07-11-15-19 -> page 0 (1 page is 8 pixels high)
02-06-10-14-18 -> page 1
01-05-09-13-17 -> page 2
00-04-08-12-16 -> page 3
|  |  |  |  |  
v  v  v  v  v  
0  1  2  3  4 columns (each 1 pixel wide)
\end{DoxyCode}
