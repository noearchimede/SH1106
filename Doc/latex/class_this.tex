\subsection{Detailed Description}
to communicate with an S\+H1106 through i2c interface

\doxyref{This}{p.}{class_this} class provides low level i2c functions specific to the A\+Tmega328 microcontroller (like {\ttfamily init()} and {\ttfamily start()}) as well as higher level functions that match S\+H1106 requirements (e.\+g. {\ttfamily send\+Command()} and {\ttfamily control\+Byte()}).

The public functions are defined in the \doxyref{S\+H1106\+\_\+interface}{p.}{class_s_h1106__interface} abstract class. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
